 #Inner Light

 STA_innerLight_event.1.name: "Danger?"
 STA_innerLight_event.1.desc: "The alien vessel above [From.GetName] activates as the short range scan initiates. The drone emits a nucleonic beam directly at captain [Root.GetLeaderName] which causes him to immediately fall to the floor. Number one initiates red alert and a medical team rushes to the bridge. \n\nAt first glance [Root.GetLeaderName] appears to be knocked out, but the Chief medical officer quickily realises that the captain is in fact sleeping in a deep REM cycle. \n[Root.GetLeaderName] is generating neurotransmitters at unprecedented levels and appears to be having vivid dreams!"
 STA_innerLight_event.1.a: "Put up a shield to cut off the beam."
 STA_innerLight_event.1.b: "Lock on weapons and destroy the alien vessel."
 STA_innerLight_event.1.c: "Try to get out of range from the drone."
 
 STA_innerLight_event.2.name: "Medical Response"
 STA_innerLight_event.2.desc: "The Chief Medical Officer thinks that that cutting off the beam is not a good idea, after all you have no idea what effect suddenly removing the beam might have on the captain"
 STA_innerLight_event.2.a: "We have to do something! Shields up."
 STA_innerLight_event.2.b: "You are right, we will try to get out of range of the drone."

 STA_innerLight_event.3.name: "Alien Vessel Destroyed"
 STA_innerLight_event.3.desc: "The science vessel locks its meagre weapons onto the drone and fires. \n\nWith a silent explosion, the drone disappears in a cloud of debris, cutting off the nucleon beam. The captain remains in his sleeping state for a minute, before suddenly screaming and spasming violently on the floor. \n\nThe medical team try to restrain him, but they fear the worst as all their treatments are not having any effect!\n\nAfter 10 more gruesome minutes of torment, [Root.GetLeaderName] lets out a sigh and dies."
 STA_innerLight_event.3.a: "We should not mess with things we do not understand."
 STA_innerLight_event.3.b: "An unavoidable tragedy."
 
 STA_innerLight_event.4.name: "The Drone Follows"
 STA_innerLight_event.4.desc: "The helmsman maneuvers the ship away from the drone, but even at full impulse it manages to keep up with your ship and continue firing its nucleonic beam at [Root.GetLeaderName]."
 STA_innerLight_event.4.a: "We cannot wait any longer! We have to raise the shields."
 STA_innerLight_event.4.b: "The captain seems alright so we will wait and see."
 
 STA_innerLight_event.5.name: "Shields Up"
 STA_innerLight_event.5.desc: "The shields have cut off the beam, and for a moment the captain seems fine. \n\nSuddenly, [Root.GetLeaderName] bursts into a violent fit of screams and spasms, the Medical Officer begs you to turn off the shields before they lose the captain."
 STA_innerLight_event.5.a: "Turn off the shields, we have to wait this out."
 STA_innerLight_event.5.b: "Destroy the Drone! Lock weapons and fire!"
 
 STA_innerLight_event.6.name: "Alien Vessel Destroyed"
 STA_innerLight_event.6.desc: "The science vessel locks its meagre weapons onto the drone and fires. \n\nWith a silent explosion, the drone disappears in a cloud of debris. The captain continues his violent screaming and spasming on the floor. \n\nThe medical team try to restrain him, but they fear the worst as all their treatments are not having any effect!\n\nAfter 10 more gruesome minutes of torment, [Root.GetLeaderName] lets out a sigh and dies."
 STA_innerLight_event.6.a: "We should not have intervened when we did not understand."
 STA_innerLight_event.6.b: "An unavoidable tragedy."
 
 STA_innerLight_event.7.name: "Waiting..."
 STA_innerLight_event.7.desc: "15 minutes pass as the captain seems to sleep soundly, the crew is uneasy about allowing an alien vessel to so easily paralyze [Root.GetLeaderName]."
 STA_innerLight_event.7.a: "We must wait, we do not know anything about this beam."
 STA_innerLight_event.7.b: "We cannot keep waiting, destroy the drone!"
 
 STA_innerLight_event.8.name: "Waking Dreams"
 STA_innerLight_event.8.desc: "After another long 10 minutes, the drone finally turns off its nucleonic beam. [Root.GetLeaderName] slowly comes to, surrounded by medical staff. The captain looks around as if seeing the bridge for the first time, reciting the names of crew members as if they were distant memories. \n\nThe crew fill in [Root.GetLeaderName] on what happened, and the captain is stunned that he was only asleep for 25 minutes. He has experienced an entire lifetime of memories, living in a simulation of life on a long dead planet. The alien drone created this simulation as a way to keep the memory of their civilisation alive. \n\n[Root.GetLeaderName] Orders the drone to be locked on with a tractor beam and brought into the cargo bay for further study.\n\nAn examination of the alien drone yields an age old flute, which seems to have special meaning to [Root.GetLeaderName]. The Captain has gained wisdom beyond his years through his time spent in the simulation."
 STA_innerLight_event.8.a: "We are glad to have you back [Root.GetLeaderName]."
