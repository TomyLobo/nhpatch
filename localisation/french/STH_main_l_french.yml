 pc_i_class_desc:0 "Class-I planets are commonly known as ice giants. Whereas gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, ice giants are primarily composed of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. While they still have a hydrogen envelope in their upper atmosphere, the hydrogen never reaches the depths required to form metallic hydrogen."
 pc_s_class:0 "Classe s (Supergéant Gazeux)"
 pc_s_class_desc:0 "Class-S planets are extremely large gas giants planets which are still below the threshold mass for stellar fusion. Due to their large mass, they experience significantly higher temperatures and pressures in their cores and have larger magnetospheres - but they tend to be less dense than smaller Gas Giants. Since their surface temperature is higher, they often have water clouds.\n\nClass S rank as Class II or III Gas Giant's on the pre-warp Sudarsky's Gas Giant Classification. Their surface temperature can reach up to 80 Celsius. Due to Rayleigh scattering they tend to be rather featureless."
 pc_u_class:0 "Classe s (Ultragéant Gazeux)"
 pc_u_class_desc:0 "Class-U planets are truly giganatic gas giants whose extreme levels of mass are still enough to maintain a steady stellar fusion. Thus they straddle the line between gas giants and brown dwarf stars.\n\nClass U rank as Class IV or V Gas Giant's on the pre-warp Sudarsky's Gas Giant Classification. Their surface temperature can reach above 1100 Celsius. At this blazing temperature, Class U planets have an atmosphere composed of materials that are solid on Class M planets, with clouds of Silicon, Iron and Sodium and are visually distinct by clear spectral lines."
 pc_barren_broken:0 "Planète brisée"

 pc_g_star:0 "Étoile De Classe G"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Étoile De Classe K"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life."
 pc_m_star:0 "Étoile De Classe M"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe, they are often referred to as red dwarves and some are as old as the galaxy. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_black_hole:0 "Trou Noir"
 pc_black_hole_desc:0 "Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, usually at least five times the mass of Sol.

 pc_neutron_star:0 "Étoile Neutronique"
 pc_neutron_star_desc:0 "These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star, but not massive enough to result in a black hole, suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star."
 pc_pulsar:0 "Pulsar"
 pc_pulsar_desc:0 "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy."

The leader of the First Federation, the President, has only the powers of a figure head, while the very little actual power is fought over by the various committees.

The Corporate was established by several academic concerns on Shelia for the sole purpose of dictating all regulation involved with interstellar affairs, including colonization, commerce and diplomacy.

While this form of government can be myriad in indecision, the Cooperative has clear guidelines that allow local leaders to act when needed, often ceasing a great deal of temporal power. While there is certainly an enormous potential for future abuse, so far, the Cooperative functions well, as every ex-drone remembers the horror of their lack of individuality, and will never dream of limiting the freedom of their compatriots."

When that Leader is an eternal, mechanical being of great intellect, however, something truly different emerges. The Leader represents everything the Collective ever aspired to be but never succeeded, and it is the center of every facet of the new Empire. With its great computational speed and full, remote access to every ex-drone, the Leader is also capable of making almost every decision in the Empire."

 gov_elder_council_desc:0 "The Kelpien government is a unique combination of a fully egalitarian society where every member of the herd is equal, elder worship and ancient feudal roots. The Kelpien never had a war between them, but their original roots stem in local, nomadic herds that clung together for protection. Millennia ago, those small kingdom/herds, or duchies as they become known, swore allegiance to the ancient Empire - ruled by a small collection of Kelpien that were brave and skilled enough to protect the other duchies from predators. In time, the Empire became a free union where each duchy is represented by an Elder Kelpien with senses developed to an almost mystical ability. Nowadays, the Elders are selected by popular vote, but they are still, more often the naught, true Elders."

The Council was a loose body that represented the leaders, fleet admirals and ship captains of the great Museums of Hur'q - vast, floating, nomadic ships that harvested, scavenged, curated and displayed biological beings and technological advances from across the galaxy. After the fall of the Domain and the Purge, the only Hur'q left alive in the galaxy were the few museum Curators that had the wisdom to flee to the corners of the galaxy. Over centuries, those fleets slowly returned, establishing a new government, a council of the most powerful, ruthless and cunning Curator-War-Captains."

Members of each Lattice also choose Magistrates, that make decisions in case of emergencies or deal with all external matters. Tholian ship captains are chosen by their peers, in a similar fashion. The Tholian Assembly is ruled by several organizations made by volunteering Magistrates, that are chosen for life to serve in their new post by virtue of merit and performance. The highest organization is the Ruling Conclave, that has little executive power but holds the entire knowledge of every Lattice in the Assembly."

Using hydrogen fuel suspended in a cryogenic state, fuel is fed through a fusion reactor power conduit and energizes into plasma. When fired, the plasma is ejected via a linear magnetic accelerator as a bolt of superheated matter. The plasma projectile is extremely effective at eating through ship armor, but suffers from a slow rate of fire and does not hit the target instantaneously.\n"

Due to the fact that anti-protons only annihilate with protons, and all Baryonic matter has at least one proton, antiprotons are very dangerous. This makes storing antiprotons very difficult, as it would have to be a perfect vacuum. antiprotons are created in a particle accelerator conduit using Hydrogen at high energies, then is contained in a powerful magnetic field, and when fired the concentrated anti-protons are fired at a constant rate causing massive damage to the target. This weapon is good against ship hull, but quite energy-draining due to the 'perfect conditions' antiprotons need to be stored and produced in.\n"
