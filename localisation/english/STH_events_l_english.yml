Destroyers are very versatile and can equip a very wide range of different weapons. They are also the first ship you possess that can equip consoles, powerful little components that boost your ship in a specific way, from cloaking generators to various bridge stations.\n\nBut what the Destroyer really excels in, is handling fleets of smaller ships. Destroyers computers have a bonus to tracking, which helps against ships with high evasion. More importantly, Destroyers are the only ship that can install Snare auras - like tractor beams and illegal subspace weapons. Naughty. Those auras can slow your enemy and even trap them in the same solar system, so you can kill at your leisure."

Kudos to you! \n\nBut don't forget that a federation is for life, not just for the Lohlunat. \n\nYou'll notice your influence income has fallen. You don't have to be omniscient like me to realise this is a consequence of the difficulties inherent to forming a new galactic state.

So many tiny cells clinging together for warmth...\n\nStill, I suppose you want to build more of them considering you don't do the whole 'colonising planets' thing. So listen up.\n\nYou cannot expand via colony ships. Instead, you can use your constructor ships and the megastructure menu to build a new Helix.\n\nIt will require a great deal of resources, and you can only build a Helix around a §Ggas giant inside your own borders§!, so consider establishing an outpost station first to stake your claim to the system. \n\nIn the right hands, you can spread across the galaxy like the genetically-engineered menace that you are."
 sth_q_events.22.name:0 "Facts and figures about utilities..."
 sth_q_events.22.desc:0 "A good ship design is like a work of art: subtle, nuanced, and with eyes that follow you across the room. It's important to know what you are doing, and that's why I'm here. \n\nOne of the most important things to consider is how you assign §Yutilities §!. There are three types: §GTactical §!, in red, §GEngineering §!, in gold and §GSupport §! in blue. Each utility offers different benefits and optimisations for you to exploit. \n\nTactical slots typically grant a variety of bonuses to weapons damage, range and performance. Engineering utilities offer additional defensive capabilities. Support slots provide generally afford bonuses to speed, evasion or accuracy. \n\nYou can place additional backup reactors in all three utility slots for additional power. \n\nBeyond these are the auxiliary slots which provide a variety of out-of-combat bonuses."
 sth_q_events.50.name:0 "Environmental controls?"

You can walk freely on planets in environments that would kill them in seconds. \n\nYou can control these environments; sculpt planets that are far too hostile for any other being in the galaxy but yourselves. Bravo, mon gentillement. Bravo. \n\nThis comes with a price, of course. Terraforming will be limited and expensive, even if it will let you access planets other species cannot. \n\nMake sure to read your terraforming technology description carefully, as it will mention the planet classes you can terraform. \n\nYou can also construct environmental domes on low-habitability worlds to make them seem a little more like home..."

 sth_q_events.1010.desc:0 "Solid. Dependable. Simple. No, I don't mean you, of course, I mean your new ship class! The Cruiser! I have no doubt very soon it will be the backbone of your fleet. It may take a major investment of resource and time to build, but they are powerful, sturdy and easy to maintain. It is, in fact, one of the most durable ships you will ever be able to build.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The Cruiser is a very capable platform - while it does not have the pure offensive capability of other classes, it does compensate it with the ability to equip a great deal of utilities and even a unique Debuff aura. Those powerful modules can play havoc with your enemy, using every dirty trick in the book. I approve. Why, it's almost like the Cruiser is a honorary Q!"
 sth_q_events.1011.name:0 "Battlecruisers!"
 sth_q_events.1011.desc:0 "Ah, the battlecruiser. You've finally done it, you worked your little peons to death and now they know how to make this truly wonderful craft. As powerful as a shark, as nimble as a Tungasian Space-Beetle. What's that? You've never heard of the Tungasian Beetle? Marvelous creatures.\n\nThe battlecruiser is all teeth. It also has a unique Long-Range Combat Sensor, that turns your battlecruiser into a mobile artillery that pummels your enemies from afar. Not only that, but a battlecruiser is a pure military vessel. You can produce it quickly and cheaply, and spring back to action after a defeat.\n\nThese noble vessels are to be protected, however! They do not have the protection your cruisers have, and caught unaware, they can easily be destroyed. In fact, it is almost inevitable. I have half a mind to just make you forget about this ship altogether, because we both know you're just going to let it die. But in the right hands and with the right weaponry, it can be a true power."
 sth_q_events.1012.name:0 "Battleship, or battlesheep? Get it?"
 sth_q_events.1012.desc:0 "My, that seems rather heavy. Are you sure you need to much plating? Well, say hello to your new Battleship. \n\nWhile in time you may still develop even more powerful ship classes, don't count on them to be as enduring. They also carry powerful support systems that can tip the scale of the battle in your favor by helping your allies and snaring your enemies.\n\nBattleships do not have the most powerful weapon loadouts, so be sure to round out any fleet they're in with heavier guns. \n\nThey're expensive and take time to replace. Don't misplace one like you would your keys."
 sth_q_events.1013.name:0 "When the Fat Escort sings"
 sth_q_events.1013.desc:0 "It's true, I have made fun of your pitiful little ships in the past, but I LIKE this one. The name Heavy Escort doesn't really convey its almost delightfully psychotic tendencies. It is violent to a fault, stacked full of short-range and heavy-duty weaponry. It also comes equipped with a unique Short-Range Combat Sensor that gives your ship an extra kick at close range.\n\nDespite having a fire-power comparable to a battleship, it is as small and maneuverable as a destroyer. While it is indeed not as durable as other, larger ships, its high evasion often allows it to stand toe to toe with the most powerful ships in the fleet. Use these ships well, and they can turn the tide of battle."
 sth_q_events.1014.name:0 "When cruisers assault..."
 sth_q_events.1014.desc:0 "Fast, deadly, puffy… wait, not that one. Still, do we really need to go through it again? This is the sixth time… oh, very well. Yes, the assault cruiser is a new class of ship. Yes, it is deadlier than all those that came before it. More expensive too, and most probably the last ship your puny scientists will be able to develop.\n\nThe Assault Cruiser is as nimble as a much smaller ship, while carrying almost as much defenses as a battleship and the most powerful weapons in your arsenal. It can take down a small fleet by itself. That being said, it is very expensive, hard to maintain and lacks the degree of specialization cruisers and battleships have."
 sth_q_events.3000.name:0 "I liked it so I put a replicator on it"
 sth_q_events.3000.desc:0 "I find it hard to remember sometimes that you mortals can't just snap your fingers and have everything you want just handed to you. No, you need... infrastructure and what not, all the accoutrement of civilization.\n\nSo let's make this simple - certain buildings will raise your peoples quality of living, and will generate a unique resource called £prosperity §YProsperity§!. Accumulate enough Prosperity and you can unlock higher §YLiving Standards§! that increase the happiness of your people. You can access living standards via the species rights menu. Yes, living standards have an upkeep cost, but really, would you put a price on your citizen's happiness?\n\nOH? You would? How dreadful."
 sth_q_events.3001.name:0 "Dilithium for the Masses"
 sth_q_events.3001.desc:0 "Ah yes Dilithium, truly wonderful crystals! \n\nYou can accumulate them in two different ways - either build a dilithium mine on planetary tiles that have a £dil_raw §YDilithium§! deposit on them, or build a mining station around a £dil_raw §YDilithium§! deposit on some forsaken asteroid. \n\nBoth methods will produce £dil_raw §YRaw Dilithium§! which then needs to be processed in a dedicated refinery facility. That will get you £dil_proc §YProcessed Dilithium§!. \n\nBetter refineries will be able to produce more Processed Dilithium per Raw Dilithium deposit. You can even build a small synthetic refinery on your Starbases for a small kick of Processed Dilithium. \n\nGather more Processed Dilithium to get a passive bonus to your empire naval capacity. Note that this modifier updates only once a year, so give it time!"
 sth_q_events.3002.name:0 "A REALLY deep space station"
 sth_q_events.3002.desc:0 "Well, here we are. You accumulated enough unity and soon you will be able to purchase a new tradition. So many options, it's a wonder your puny little brain doesn't explode. There are many paths you could choose from, but one will give you access to something truly unique - Deep Space Stations.\n\nThese are more than your regular starbases - those are large, expensive, crewed stations that you can build far from your borders and stake your claim. The station has access to its own unique buildings, among them a dilithium refinery, but also tools that will allow the station to build large fleets quickly, or expand your borders even further. \n\nYou are limited by how many stations you can build and how large you can expand them, but further traditions can increase those limits."
 sth_q_events.3003.name:0 "Holy Army Batman!"
 sth_q_events.3003.desc:0 "Those are... a lot of little armies you have there. Trying to compensate for something?\n\nJust remember that at any given time, your fleets can not be bigger than 50 ships. Apparently that's a thing now. Once you embark your armies on some foolish notion of an invasion or whatnot, they will automatically become army transport ships - and subject to the fleet limit.\n\nSo make sure at no time you have more than 50 armies on any planet, or when you embark them, they will disappear into the same place where Q dreams go."
 sth_q_events.3006.name:0 "Colony-Ho"
 sth_q_events.3006.desc:0 "There is something truly noble about colonization: crossing the great beyond in flimsy colony ships, landing on some distant planet and calling it home. It is enough to bring a tear to an old Q's eye, it really does.\n\nConstructing a colony ship is a huge undertaking - those are truly vast ships. You should show great care in how you design them, then. In time you will discover the knowledge of various Colony Modules, that will be activated as soon as the colony is established.\n\nYour first one merely strengthens the hull of the ship, but in time you can install modules such as a pre-fabricated building module that will instantly build a few structures on your colony, to even stasis chambers that will deliver an additional population to the surface. Choose wisely!"

I can say I approve, but if they are doing so, you may as well gain something while they do it, hmmm?\n\nYou might note that your science ships can also equip Science Modules. Many of those modules will give you small benefits as you survey the cosmos, such as additional resources and research. Others allow you to use your science ships in various ways even when they are not out surveying, allowing you to equip your ships with civilian facilities, diplomatic quarters and even gambling dens. Take note of the modules you unlock along the way."

Hundreds of years later we will find out Mars once had moving rivers and seas, even a basic eco-system, only to lose it to an ever-depleting atmosphere. Now is our chance to restore Mars to its former glory. Even as we look to other solar systems and their wealth of colonizable planets, the Mars Initiative seeks to terraform the red planet. \n\nThe head of the project, engineer Paul Boone, says that with the help of the Verteron Array, it will be possible to nudge comets and asteroids out of their orbit and force them to crash onto the polar ice-cap of Mars. This will release carbon dioxide and water vapor into the atmosphere, and eventually, bring life back to the barren planet. The project lead estimates the project could take at least eight years, and potentially a great deal more.\n\n§GRemember the Verteron Array must be manned by a pop at all times, or your terraforming project will not advance.§!"

 STH_mars.111.desc:0 "Sir!' shouted one of the xenopaleobotonists further down the cave. They were located two kilometers below the Martian surface, not far from the edges of the Garni Crater. The entire cave formation was only revealed recently, after an especially rough quake that followed a comet strike brought down the covering walls. The geological structure immediately attracted the attention of local science teams because the cave held trace element of an especially important molecule: water.\n\nPaul Boone, leader of the Mars terraforming initiative, followed the call deeper inside the cave. A small group of researchers were crouched near a small, tapering pillar, whispering excitedly. As he grew closer, he could see the beam of light illuminating a small, shallow pool of water, covered by an organic looking metallic sheen. The biologists were moving their tricorders again and again. There, in the briny water, were millions of fossilized insects. Evidence that Mars did carry life, once upon a time."
 STH_mars.111.a:0 "An incredible find!"
 STH_mars.112.desc:0 "The ground control crew stared helplessly at the monitors. 'Send an evacuation order!' yelled someone, but others were just shaking their head numbly. 'It's too late' muttered someone else.\n\nAn hour ago, is was simply another routine day in the Mars Initiative control center, with no less than five comets scheduled to crash into the ice cap. Then, shortly after contact with the now-thicker atmosphere, an unmapped pocket of volatiles on a comet erupted, sending the comet into a spin. As the comet plunged toward the Martian surface, more and more gas pockets burst. The comet was shredding itself apart, now on a trajectory toward New Armstrong Base. A few ground vehicles managed to escape the base dome in time, but even they didn't survive the ensuing nuclear blast as a comet fragment hit Mars with the strength of 300 megatons of TNT. Fifty thousand people died in what would be known at the worse terraforming disaster of this century."
 STH_mars.112.a:0 "They will not die in vain."
 STH_mars.121.desc:0 "The tension in the control room was palpable. A flotilla of tugs was pulling the last segments of the mirror into position, and even a millimeter misalignment of the 5 kilometer wide complex could ruin the great assembly. Boone paced back and forth along the small chamber, making a small indentation in the carpet. The controller gazed at him, irritated, thought of asking him again to sit down, thought better of it, and continued his work.\n\nTen minutes later, however, there was no more need to worry. The sensor grid reported every single segment was properly aligned. Ponderously, Xeon-plasma jets kicked in, making the final adjustment. Then the mirror was angled just so, and suddenly, pure, blessed sunlight blasted across the Martian surface, reflected from above. Already, surface temperatures were climbing. Boone grinned at the monitor, and hurried to report to his superiors. The controller shook his head, mentally switching his focus to the next mirror complex under construction."
 STH_mars.121.a:0 "These mirrors will usher in a new age for Mars."
 STH_mars.122.desc:0 "The infestation started over two months ago, in the remote reaches of Malea Planum. The southern ice cap was seeded with a highly modified anaerobic bacterium, that injected contaminants in the ice-water, releasing a small amount of heat in the process. There were many genetic safeguards and a very simplistic DNA strand should have been proper protection against mutation. It wasn't.\n\nA freak change in allele activation allowed the bacteria to inject more complex organic molecules. In the past desolate Mars would offer very little in organic material, but Mars surface has been seeded with other strains of bacteria that fertilized the soil. Within a week, the ice-cap bacteria subsumed all other strains, spreading like wildfire along the empty plains of southern Mars. When it was eventually discovered, it was almost too late - the bacteria were everywhere, covering the surface with a thin, grey crust. The damage to the ecosystem is vast - it may very well set back the project for years."
 STH_mars.122.a:0 "We must eradicate it, before all is lost."
 STH_mars.130.desc:0 "A small delegation of researchers is leaving the Terraforming lab. In the distance, explosions can be heard, carried across the thin atmosphere. Engineer Boone glances at his timepiece - comet ZA2112-B crashed into the northern polar ice cap right on schedule. Minor quakes shake the surface and quickly dissipate, and miles-high geysers of superheated steam stretching into the atmosphere. Boone glances at the sight and smiles, before firmly grasping the seals of his breathing masks and pulling it free. The rest of the delegation stare at him warily. This is why they came here, but the risk is still great.\n\nPaul Boone is the first human being to take a fresh breath of Martian air. After years of work, the atmosphere is finally thick enough for a human to breath it unaided. There is still much to do before Mars will truly be a paradise, but this is a monumental step forward for Humanity."

 STH_mars.140.name:0 "Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies"
 STH_mars.140.desc:0 "Representatives from all over Mars stood ill at ease in one corner of the mess hall Schiaparelli Base as attendants hurried to drag in more seats. The hall was ill-fitting for such a distinguished occasion, but rugged Mars has yet to manufacture anything else that could house such a large gathering. Finally, they were all allowed to enter.\n\nThe red planet is no more, replaced with something that appears almost green. Thousands of migrants from Earth flock here, and the population is booming. It is clear to everyone something must be done.\n\nA short while later, after the meeting commenced, John Hammerlich, now old and distinguished, stepped in front of the short podium. He was the representative of Gundersdottir's Dome, one of the largest in the 22nd colonies of Mars, and his gravelly voice spoke for all.\n\n'We stand here, not unlike our forefathers did in the grand old city of Philadelphia, not to cast of tyranny but to embrace freedom. We take the first step today, as we make the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies'."
 STH_mars.140.a:0 "This will not be an easy negotiation."
 STH_mars.141.desc:0 "It was one of the most ambitious articles in the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies. As the terraforming process progressed, more and more resources shifted to Mars. The air was still thin, but people could walk unaided on the surface and truly tame this new world. The confederated Martian colonies have decided they will initiate a construction project that will rival any of that on Earth.\n\nA lucky draw picked Utopia colony, a tiny hamlet on the Utopia Planitia lava plane, as the site. Within a month, the small town was transformed. Within two months, the foundations of a superstructure were placed 16 thousand kilometers above the colony, in synchronous orbit. Now, the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards fill the sky with dozens of giant drydocks."
 STH_mars.141.a:0 "This is truly inspiring."
 STH_mars.142.desc:0 "It was one of the most heated contested articles in the Fundamental Declarations of the Martian Colonies. Mars was transforming under the comet barrage of the Mars Initiative, becoming a paradise for humanity, but at what price? That was, at least, the question a vocal group called 'the preservers' were asking. They called terraforming an abomination, man exerting its influence over another pristine land, one it has no right to call home. As the Preservers gained power, the newly founded senate of the Confederated Martian Colonies grew concerned.\n\nEventually and under constant pressure from the public, the senate agreed to a wide range of regulations that will severely limit the extent of the Mars Initiative. No one seemed happy with the solution, and the terraforming of Mars has been delayed for years."
 STH_mars.142.a:0 "We must respect their views."
 STH_mars.143.desc:0 "Years ago, when there was still a Pope in Rome, when the last Pope died, the cardinals would gather and debate who would be his successor. They were not allowed to leave until a decision could be made. Once, it almost took three years... thank goodness, it did not take so long this time. It only felt that way said Hammerlich ponderously, to polite laughter. In truth, everyone felt on edge - the negotiations, initially expected to be brief and cordial, quickly turned ugly.\n\nYet in the end, the key disputes - access to future water-ways - was agreed upon, and from there, things progressed quickly and an accord was met. Mars now has its own constitution and federal government, independent but forever bound to Earth. The destiny of a world was decided, and for once in humanity's history, it was not decided with blood."
 STH_mars.143.a:0 "It was a long process, but at least it is over."
 STH_mars.151.desc:0 "In a hundred years or so, this new shiny research facility will no longer be the Carl Sagan Institute of Technology. Richard Daystrom in all his dazzling, maddening, brilliant glory will reshape the galaxy, and acquire the name to himself. But well before that, the venerable annex will already be a bastion of research and academia.\n\nInspired by the pioneering spirit of old and the new Fundamental Declaration charter, the local Martians have decided they must be able to rival Earth not only in industry but in their contribution to mankind as well. This vision lasted into the future, making Mars one of the most respected scientific institutes in the galaxy."
 STH_mars.151.a:0 "A remarkable building."
 STH_mars.152.desc:0 "In hindsight, it was not clear what the rebellion was even about. Mars was flourishing under the Initiative, but the older settlers, those that lived on Mars for dozens of years before the flood of migrants from Earth, grew even more resentful. Was it about land? Control? Power? Preserving the old ways? All the above, or none? All we know is that almost overnight, the planet was in frenzy, riots on every dome.\n\nThe overwhelmed local government tried to control the situation, but before anyone even noticed, an armed group of local colonists stormed the Verteron Array compound, gaining access to a weapon of terrific puissance. With a single, defiant act, they shuttered the Initiative, halting the project and rallying rebels across the planet."
 STH_mars.152.a:0 "We have no choice. Contact M.A.C.O HQ."
 STH_mars.154.desc:0 "The strike, when it came, was over swiftly. What took several weeks of careful planning, lasted less than a single violent, intense hour. A M.A.C.O team infiltrated the Verteron Array compound at several locations at the same times using a transporter technique that by-passed the inhibitor field. Despite a few casualties, most of the rebels surrendered on the spot.\n\nThe rest of the Martian rebellion did not last much more. A few enclaves held out, but most surrendered when news came of the fall of the compound. The Martian colonies were at peace once again, and within a few days the terraforming resumed.\n\nThe seeds of discontent, however, will not disappear as swiftly. One can only hope they will not grow, and fester."

Their political pressure can be felt throughout the industrial sector on Earth. The Project's resources are quickly dwindling, and many employees of the Warp Five Complex have been reassigned to different projects.\n\nWhile the Enterprise hull floats proudly in Space Dock, in truth it is but an empty shell.
