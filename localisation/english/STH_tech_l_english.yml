 tech_physics_field_manipulation_173_desc:0 "We have discovered that the interfold layers between normal space and subspace contain numerous roaming high energy subspace oscillations. Theoretically, bombarding an oscillation with triaxilating tetryons will amplify it, causing a low energy distortion to form. As this distortion weakens the separation barrier between normal space and subspace, it should allow easier access to transwarp space."

 tech_physics_field_manipulation_175_desc:0 "Transwarp conduits can be modulated in a number of ways. We've calculated a set of parameters that'll optimise them to minimise our vessels travel time. The transwarp apertures must be permanently open in order to maintain this optimal modulation. As per prior requirements, transwarp aperture projection installations were not designed to stabilise the opening, and will have to be redesigned."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_176:0 "Dynamic Transwarp Hub"

 tech_physics_aldean_100_desc:0 "The Aldeans were a proud and mighty people. Their science and art are legendary to the ends of myths. The myth became fact when Aldea was discovered. Aldea became a legend by use of a planetary scale cloaking device. This cloak uses energy fields to repolarize the atoms in the upper atmosphere to become a massive impenetrable cloak. In 2364, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew discovered Aldea."
 tech_physics_defensive_83:0 "Defensive Force Fields"
 tech_physics_defensive_83_desc:0 "It has been found that dense fields of gravitons can absorb or deflect a range of harmful phenomena. Current graviton emitters do not allow for a whole ship to be encompassed. However, they can create force fields inside a ship to seal hull breaches and absorb structural stress from incoming fire. This should improve the durability of a ship's hull."
 tech_physics_advanced_84:0 "Advanced Field Manipulations"
 tech_physics_advanced_84_desc:0 "Graviton manipulation technology has matured to the point that large fields of gravitons can be generated and controlled for sustained periods of time.

 tech_physics_multi-spatial_91_desc:0 "Subspace theory application engineers have been experimenting with extruding graviton fields into subspace. If this can be applied to a starships shield matrix, it will make the ship much harder to scan and track. The general improvements to shield emitter technology resulting from this work should slightly boost the performance of internal force field systems."
 tech_physics_extendable_87:0 "Extendable Shield Emitters"
 tech_physics_extendable_87_desc:0 "Shield emitters can be recalibrated to change the shield's geometry. More extensive modifications can allow a shield emitter to project a shield at a greater distance from the ship. While this doesn't provide effective protection, it can be used to help re-energize the gravitons in other ships' shields if the frequencies match."
 tech_physics_multi-adaptive_92:0 "Multi-Adaptive Shielding"
 tech_physics_multi-adaptive_92_desc:0 "It has been suggested that adding additional graviton layers to the shield matrix will allow us to create a more adaptive camouflage system. The creation of a false gravimetric signature will inevitably subject the shield to disruptive gravitational forces, slightly reducing its strength. These new algorithms will better adapt a force field to the conditions of the breach it is sealing."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_192:0 "Fast Modulating Force Fields"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_192_desc:0 "Certain characteristics of an energy beam or field can be hard to ascertain during combat but these characteristics can be of great importance. Having more sensors working on detecting the modulation of an energy pulse increases the speed at which it can be determined. For this reason, it would be wise to adapt the computers of certain ships to function as fleet sensor data coordination centers."
 tech_physics_refractive_93:0 "Refractive Shielding"
 tech_physics_refractive_93_desc:0 "We have discovered a way of phasing a shield matrix that totally absorbs all common active sensor beams, rendering a ship virtually undetectable, unless more specialised scanning techniques are applied. Unfortunately, it introduces feedback into the matrix reducing its effectiveness. We have found a way of boosting force field strength by introducing controlled feedback into the field."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_194:0 "Triaxilating Extendable Shields"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_194_desc:0 "Shield emitters have struggled to maintain the coherence of medium range graviton beams. The higher the graviton density of the beam, the sooner it dissipates. If the emitters were refit with a triaxilating graviton beam behaving in a similar way to other triaxilating energy patterns, it should gain a more stable cohesion, increasing the rate that nearby ships shields can be reinforced at."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_196:0 "Spatial Refractive Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_196_desc:0 "A few proven techniques exist for using shield technology to mask the sensor signature of a ship. Early tests suggest that if refractive shields could be modified to be multi-spatial, they would gain effectiveness against an increased range of sensor technology, but also the disadvantages of multi-spatial shielding."
 tech_physics_shield_94:0 "Shield Harmonics"

 tech_physics_modulating_89:0 "Modulating Shield Frequencies"
 tech_physics_modulating_89_desc:0 "In order to form a protective shield, all of a ship's shield emitters must operate at the same frequency. If a weapons frequency matches the shield frequency, it will pass through the shield unhindered. Theoretically the opposite is true; given a weapons frequency there is a shield frequency that will negate it with the least loss to shield cohesion, if any."
 tech_physics_paratrinic_95:0 "Paratrinic Shielding"
 tech_physics_paratrinic_95_desc:0 "New developments in multi-spatial shield emitter engineering and extensive experiments with refractive shielding have lead shield harmonics specialists to create a new type of shield geometry which more efficiently absorbs destructive energy and refracts some of it into subspace. These shields can be re-energized with more efficiency than most common shields, granting an increased recharge rate."
 tech_specialization_shield:0 "Shield Technology Breakthrough"
 tech_specialization_shield_desc:0 "In recent years we have begun running limited tests on prototypes of advanced new shield systems. It has been found that these designs have differing strengths and weaknesses, suited to different situations and combat doctrines.

 tech_physics_covariant_101:0 "Covariant Shielding"
 tech_physics_covariant_101_desc:0 "Shield emitter technology has advanced enough that multiple layers of gravitons may be contained around a starship. The shield emitters would run near capacity in order to achieve this, limiting the rate at which new gravitons may be added to the matrix. This line of shield technology will focus on making the shields as strong as possible, at the expense of all other concerns."
 tech_physics_regenerative_102:0 "Regenerative Shielding"
 tech_physics_regenerative_102_desc:0 "When a shield is recharged, disruptive waveforms propagate through the shield matrix, the strength of which is a function of the recharge rate and current graviton energisation levels. Current technology struggles to speedily smooth the waveform, so to stop them growing strong enough to tear the shield emitters apart, the upper energisation level must be capped below their maximum potential."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_205:0 "Covariant Pulse Shield Generator"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_205_desc:0 "The stacked graviton layers of a covariant shield suffer from an inter-layer interference phenomenon. When emitting gravitons into the shield matrix, each layer a graviton must travel through consumes extra power. The problem can be partially mitigated, but not solved, by emitting higher energy pulses to maintain one layer at a time, starting from the furthest out."
 tech_physics_radial_103:0 "Radial Force Compensator"
 tech_physics_radial_103_desc:0 "When the shield absorbs destructive energies, the ship's hull receives some mechanical feedback through the emitters. A specialised type of inertial dampener, called a radial force compensator, can be embedded into the shield emitters. This reduces the feedback, allowing more potent shields to be used. Unfortunately, this will draw power that would otherwise be used for re-energising the shields."
 tech_physics_interphased_105:0 "Interphased Shielding Grid"
 tech_physics_interphased_105_desc:0 "In a multiphasic shield the different phases and modulations of gravitons coexist in a single layer. An interphasic shield takes this concept even further, allowing them to reinforce each other. This provides a stronger, more cohesive shield matrix. Due to the enhanced cohesion recharging the shield becomes less efficient, reducing the recharge rate."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_208:0 "Chromodynamic Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_208_desc:0 "Our scientists are making progress in understanding the concepts and relationships that underpin all types of energy. Using the current theories, lab tests have shown that the range of radiation which each graviton phase modulation interacts with could potentially be expanded. Each interphased graviton modulation could therefore reinforce other, mathematically related, modulations even further."
 tech_physics_multi-spectrum_85:0 "Multi-Spectrum Shielding"
 tech_physics_multi-spectrum_85_desc:0 "Shield effectiveness can be enhanced by surrounding a ship in multiple graviton layers. Each layer can be modulated to be most effective against specific frequency ranges of particle beams and radiation. This affords protection against a wider range of threats than older mono-spectrum shields."
 tech_physics_multiphasic_86:0 "Multiphasic Shielding"
 tech_physics_multiphasic_86_desc:0 "Refinements in the implementation of multi-spectrum shielding have led to the more advanced multi-phasic shields. By carefully modulating the phase of the gravitons emitted, the multiple layers of older designs have been compressed into a single layer. A single layer eliminates the inter-layer interference problem, providing an immediate boost in shield cohesion."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_211:0 "Hyper-Phasic Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_211_desc:0 "Taking the concept of multi-phasic shields further, initial research into hyper-phasic shielding has been conducted. A hyper-phasic shield uses quantum effects to squeeze gravitons closer together, allowing more to be added to a shield layer. This process requires both a large, continual power supply, and a significant amount of extra computing power, in order to maintain the effect."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_212:0 "Auto-Regenerative Shield Emitter"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_212_desc:0 "There are many variables that can affect shield regeneration rates. Current shield management systems use case-based reasoning databases to manage emitter parameters. It would be more effective to make use of advances in computing, and equip each shield emitter with an autonomous management system, allowing it to better adapt to its precise environmental conditions."
 tech_physics_immersion_104:0 "Immersion Shielding"
 tech_physics_immersion_104_desc:0 "Immersion Shields were originally developed to allow a craft to enter a high pressure environment but due to the constant strain on shield cohesion, having a highly energized shield isn't enough. These shields use a geometry that allows them to be recharged faster than the environment can damage them. However, they are less efficient at dissipating destructive levels of energy."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_214:0 "Multi-Staged Immersion Shielding"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_214_desc:0 "The shield geometry of immersion shielding was originally created for use in high pressure environments, not the vacuum of space. Having a series of variations of this geometry, each tailored for a different pressure range, allows the shield to be adjusted for the current circumstances. A set of suitable test sites for each pressure range will need to be located before geometry testing can begin."
 tech_physics_unimatrix_106:0 "Unimatrix shielding"
 tech_physics_unimatrix_106_desc:0 "The Borg use incredibly advanced regenerative shielding. While we aren't close to replicating it, we can use sensor records of it in action to redesign our shield emitters. These new emitters allow us to preserve the rapid recharge rate of the older emitters while supporting a higher energy shield matrix."
 tech_physics_shield_88:0 "Shield Emitter Array"
 tech_physics_shield_88_desc:0 "In theory, an array of shield emitters is more effective at recharging a ship's shield than isolated emitters. In practice, the emitters create localised interference patterns that hinder their effectiveness. The continued refinement of graviton emitters will allow for more focused graviton emissions. At long last, shield emitter arrays are within our grasp."
 tech_physics_shield_90:0 "Shield Capacitors Daisy-Chain"
 tech_physics_shield_90_desc:0 "Shield capacitors allow energy to be stored, ready for infusion into the shields. Although auxiliary batteries store more energy than capacitors they have a slower discharge time. Their high discharge rate allows for a rapid boost in shield strength the moment it is required. By reducing individual capacity and linking several in series, total capacity is preserved but discharge times are reduced."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_218:0 "Nano-Shield Capacitors"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_218_desc:0 "The miniaturisation of ultra-high discharge rate shield capacitors has reached the nanoscale which can be embedded in the hull material. Capacitor material availability, and the time required to embed it in a host material, serve to limit the amount that can be installed per starship. Despite this, a significant gain in combat shield regeneration rates is expected."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_219:0 "Gravity-Shear Tractor Beam"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_219_desc:0 "By attracting one side of an enemy spaceship while repelling the other, we can create severely damaging shear effects in its hull. Another mode of destructive use of such beams is rapid alternating between pressing and pulling force in order to cause structural damage to the ship as well as inflicting debilitating forces on its crew."
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_220:0 "Neuro-Electric Field Generator"
 tech_physics_field_manipulation_220_desc:0 "Most species lack detailed knowledge of how their brains work.

 tech_physics_particles_435:0 "Pulse Compression Wave Phaser"
 tech_physics_particles_435_desc:0 "Most phasers fire a continuous beam of nadion particles. Studies of how assault phaser beams act when impacting a target have revealed that a pulsed beam might be more effective.

 tech_physics_tunneling_342_desc:0 "Prototype compressed plasma cannons have included a number of backup and redundant systems. Using the data obtained from field testing, it is possible to safely reduce the number of redundant components. The extra space will be used to mount a second barrel. If more emitters could be brought to bear on a single convergence point then the damage potential could scale geometrically."
 tech_physics_particles_880:0 "Modulated Tetryonic Tri-Cannon"
 tech_physics_particles_880_desc:0 "The benefit of changing from a single barrel to dual barrel has not been forgotten. Using smaller components with higher tolerances should allow a triple barreled cannon to be built. By reducing the output of each cannon slightly, a higher total output can be achieved. Each barrel uses its own emitters and can be individually modulated to keep up with remodulating shields."

Soon, we will not be limited by what we can mine or smelt, but by how we tweak these materials to suit our needs, whatever we decide they are."
 tech_engineering_light_609:0 "Light Electro-Ceramic Hull Construction"
 tech_engineering_light_609_desc:0 "With the concept of 'less is more' in mind, we can develop starship hulls that are lighter while remaining strong.  This allows our ships to be more agile, while still receiving suitable protection from the rigors of space travel."
 tech_engineering_heavy_610:0 "Heavy Duranium Hull Construction"

 tech_engineering_magnesite_611_desc:0 "Magnesite is an oxide form of magnesium, one of the lightest Engineering metals on Earth. The materials light weight, high toughness and machinability make it an ideal choice for starship hulls on Corvettes and Destroyers when speed is preferred to higher armor and hull integrity"

 tech_engineering_kelindide_615:0 "Kelindide Hull"
 tech_engineering_kelindide_615_desc:0 "Kelindide is a metallic alloy that is specifically used on Cardassian ships. Some believe it is an even stronger metallic alloy than Tritanium. Luckily, we have discovered several deposits of this material within our borders and can now apply this to our own starship hulls if we wish."

 tech_engineering_low_619:0 "Low Profile Stealth Hull Design"
 tech_engineering_low_619_desc:0 "If we going to continue to advance in stealth like ships, than our hulls shouldn't be lit up like a Christmas Tree. By introducing darker materials into a ship's hull we believe we can come up with a component that will be much harder to track by sensors, but at the cost of our molecular structure."
 tech_engineering_refractive_620:0 "Refractive Hull Materials"
 tech_engineering_refractive_620_desc:0 "As we continue to look into materials that increase our manoeuvrability, we believe we have come up with another type of material that can be used on a ship's hull. This one is more refractive than most, thus reducing the amount it returns to sensors. However, the downside of introducing such a material is that it comes at a cost of our molecular structure of the ship's hull."
 tech_engineering_masking_621:0 "Masking Circuitry Adaptive Hull"
 tech_engineering_masking_621_desc:0 "Searching for more ways to improve the manoeuvrability of our ships, we have discovered a new option for us to consider. Based upon what we know of advanced circuitry, we are able to forge a new type of interwoven circuitry hull material. Like the other discoveries we have made into this type of material, it will once again reduce the molecular structure of our hull."
 tech_engineering_materials_1468:0 "Reflective Metamaterial Sheeting"
 tech_engineering_materials_1468_desc:0 "Research efforts to find a type of material that perfectly reflects enemy targeting has proven difficult, but recent advances in metamaterial sheeting could potentially allow this rare material to be mass produced."

 tech_engineering_duranium-victurium_614:0 "Duranium-Victurium Hull"
 tech_engineering_duranium-victurium_614_desc:0 "The implementation of Duranium alloy to our starships have been a monumental success. Now, we just discovered a new metal alloy called Victurium, which seems to be just as strong as Duranium and if we combine these two metallic alloys together we will have the basis of an even stronger hull that further increases the durability of our ships hull."
 tech_engineering_polyduranium_616:0 "PolyDuranium Weave Hull"
 tech_engineering_polyduranium_616_desc:0 "Another unidentified metallic alloy has been classified and this one we are calling Poly Duranium Weave. Going along the branch of our Duranium and Duranium-Victurium type alloys, this alloy is even stronger than those providing further increases to the durability of our ships hulls."
 tech_engineering_materials_1473:0 "Heavy Duranium Composite Sheeting"
 tech_engineering_materials_1473_desc:0 "Duranium is an extremely strong metal that is used by many species for starship hulls due to its suitability as armor. It is heavy though, potentially increasing a ship's mass and making it less maneuverable."

 tech_engineering_parametallic_622_desc:0 "If we want to make our starships more durable, we could look into additional materials that can be placed on the external layers of our starship hulls. By combining different types of materials together we have come up with another type of armor plating. This new type of alloy will provide the additional protection needed against weapon fire or hazardous materials a starship's hull could encounter."
 tech_engineering_ablative_623:0 "Ablative Armor"
 tech_engineering_ablative_623_desc:0 "Ablative armor is was originally designed as a primitive heat shielding for spacecraft. Over time it has been refined into an armor designed to disintegrate at a controlled rate under directed energy blasts, providing an additional layer of defense for starships."
 tech_engineering_reflective_624:0 "Reflective Armor"
 tech_engineering_reflective_624_desc:0 "Our continued advances into materials that can serve as additional layers of support for our starship hull has lead to another breakthrough. This type of material is reflective, which means it has the ability to absorb energy. By applying this type of armor plating to our ship's hull it would offer even more protection against weapon fire or other hazardous type materials."
 tech_assault_armies:0 "Interplanetary Expeditionary Forces"
 tech_assault_armies_desc:0 "When exploration turns to interstellar war, we require more people to defend our worlds and conquer those of our enemies. As these armies will be larger than any our civilisation has previously fielded, we need to revolutionise how we think about organising, training, supplying, and deploying them. The establishment of an 'Interplanetary Expeditionary Force' is the first step towards this goal."

 tech_engineering_materials_1481:0 "Personal Shields"
 tech_engineering_materials_1481_desc:0 "Personal shields have long been desired by personnel exposed to hazards. It is not just a case of miniaturising the technology enough to be wearable. Current shield implementations would make it difficult for the user to walk as well as suffocating them, but we believe we can come up with ways to circumvent that issue."
 tech_engineering_materials_1482:0 "Cortical Implants"
 tech_engineering_materials_1482_desc:0 "Cortical Implants are devices to interface humanoids with various technology. The Collective would benefit greatly, as drones would be able to interface with technology, allowing regeneration and interfacing with hostile technology."

 tech_engineering_materials_1485:0 "Tactical Drone"
 tech_engineering_materials_1485_desc:0 "Utilising the most advanced command programs and most advanced technology, tactical drones are the most advanced and skilled drones in the Collective. Assimilation of targets will be more efficient."
 tech_thrusters_1:0 "Fusion Thrusters"
 tech_thrusters_1_desc:0 "Nuclear fusion is the process of combining atoms to create larger atoms. When this occurs, energy is released. Thus, nuclear fusion reactors create incredibly hot plasma. This plasma has many uses. One such use is to expel it from a spacecraft, providing significantly more thrust than a chemical burn thruster. Miniaturising these thrusters allows them to be used in missiles and torpedoes."
 tech_engineering_inertial_629:0 "Inertia Manipulation"
 tech_engineering_inertial_629_desc:0 "The lack of motion resisting forces in space allow starships to generate extreme acceleration compared to atmospheric craft. This poses a threat to the safety of our crews, and we must hastily find a way of managing their effect on the ship. Early proposals are focusing on using graviton manipulations or gyroscopic technology, but it is likely that new forms of technology will quickly emerge."
 tech_specialization_thruster:0 "Breakthrough in Propulsion Design"
 tech_specialization_thruster_desc:0 "Despite the importance of a starships propulsion system, they have often received relatively little attention. Most improvements are simply iterations of existing designs. However, general advances in technology and a starships technical capability, mean that engineers are now developing prototypes of advanced engines. We will have to examine our needs and chose a complimentary design."
 tech_engineering_impulse_631:0 "High-Gain Impulse Thruster"
 tech_engineering_impulse_631_desc:0 "Impulse thrusters vent high energy plasma to provide thrust. There are two main distinctions between them and fusion thrusters. Impulse thrusters can use plasma from a warp core in addition to a fusion reactor, and they generally use a more complex exhaust manifold to greatly increase their efficiency. By further developing this technology, we can achieve even greater sublight speeds."
 tech_engineering_low_632:0 "Low Temperature Thruster"
 tech_engineering_low_632_desc:0 "Low temperature thrusters have a lower top speed, but make up for it with a smaller sensor footprint. This is useful during combat where tracking a fast, evasive starship, which is equipped with a variety of countermeasures, can be difficult. When these thrusters fire, it takes marginally longer for a hostile ship to isolate their signature, increasing the chance that an evasive move will succeed."
 tech_engineering_materials_1491:0 "Anti-Gravity Assisted Impulse Drive"
 tech_engineering_materials_1491_desc:0 "Current generation impulse drives use as much of the high energy plasma as they can. We will need to think of a different approach to increase our starships speeds. One possible solution is to create an anti-gravity wake behind the ship, repelling it in the direction of travel. This application of graviton technology has not been attempted before, doubtlessly there will be hurdles to overcome."
 tech_engineering_avidyne_633:0 "Avidyne Impulse"
 tech_engineering_avidyne_633_desc:0 "Research on gravity assisted engines has been abandoned. Our technology and scientific knowledge are not yet advanced enough to make it work correctly. For now, the Avidyne Propulsion Research and Testing Complex is attempting to apply the latest plasma dynamics research to impulse engines. New engine designs based on this work should allow us to use impulse plasma more effectively."
 tech_engineering_improved_635:0 "Improved Impulse Manifold"
 tech_engineering_improved_635_desc:0 "Avidyne impulse drives have suffered from handling problems, often being described as twitchy or jumpy. This problem has been traced to incompatibilities between the pulsed plasma exhaust, and the exhaust manifold geometry. This manifold design was restricted by the materials available. As new materials have been developed, it might now be possible to design a compatible manifold geometry."
 tech_engineering_materials_1494:0 "Shange Shunt Interface"
 tech_engineering_materials_1494_desc:0 "Engineers widely agree that modern warp cores can supply enough high energy plasma to meet our impulse engines demands, without requiring fusion reactors. Many engineering challenges must be overcome to facilitate this change. For example, new plasma shunts will be required to balance the load between the thruster array exhaust ports, without causing instability in the plasma flow characteristics."
 tech_engineering_materials_1495:0 "Compound Impulse Assembly"
 tech_engineering_materials_1495_desc:0 "The success of Shange shunt interfaces has opened new opportunities for impulse manifold designers. Ideas for a multi-vector thruster manifold have been drawn up, but current impulse assemblies can not support the design. We will need to create a new assembly, likely building it from miniaturised assembly segments, to form a flexible, compound impulse assembly."
 tech_engineering_hyper-impulse_637:0 "Hyper-Impulse Engine"
 tech_engineering_hyper-impulse_637_desc:0 "Taking the concept of warp reactor driven impulse engines to its logical conclusion, means having dedicated matter-antimatter reactors powering the impulse engines. These small reactors will feed the impulse engines with warp plasma, which is usually reserved for energising the warp coils. There are significant engineering challenges between now, and a working prototype fitted into a starship."
 tech_engineering_driver_639:0 "Driver Coil Assembly"
 tech_engineering_driver_639_desc:0 "When people think of warp coils, they always think of huge, power hungry coils that reside inside the nacelles of a ship. It should be possible to build much smaller warp coils and mount them behind the impulse manifold, where they will be moderately energised by the impulse plasma. This will not allow warp travel, but it will decrease the ship's mass and make the impulse engine more effective."
 tech_engineering_ullage_640:0 "Ullage Gronerium Afterburner"
 tech_engineering_ullage_640_desc:0 "Although more advanced propulsion systems are now the standard, older style chemical thrusters have a range of uses. The latest high performance fuel to be synthesised is a liquid called Gronerium. Before we can begin using this fuel, we must design a modern liquid fuel storage system, overcoming the reliability problems inherent to using liquid fuelled thrusters in low gravity environments."
 tech_engineering_inertial_641:0 "Inertial Retrothruster Afterburner"
 tech_engineering_inertial_641_desc:0 "Inertial dampeners absorb the inertial force generated by impulse and warp drive acceleration. It is theoretically possible to use the dampeners in reverse and provide limited acceleration. Current inertial dampeners don't have the capability to do so, as it would increase their size and power consumption. By designing new dampeners we can equip starships with them if required."
 tech_engineering_materials_1500:0 "FIB-3 Afterburner"
 tech_engineering_materials_1500_desc:0 "Although fusion reactors are becoming obsolete in primary impulse drives, they still have a place in secondary propulsion. The Fusion Intermix Booster project is attempting to use a fusion reactor to create thrust plasma, but then mix it with a small amount of antimatter to increase its temperature to 43keV. Heat and pressure stress induced structural integrity failures are still causing problems."
 tech_engineering_materials_1501:0 "Sub-Impulse Paralithium Thruster"
 tech_engineering_materials_1501_desc:0 "Paralithium synthesis technology has long been on the watchlist of Avidyne Stealth R&D Yards. Experimental paralithium engines have been shown to produce relatively cold, highly ionised plasma. Hopefully, this can be combined with ion engine technology to create a potent cold thruster. A new paralithium synthesis technique, yielding two orders of magnitude more fuel, will allow research to resume."
 tech_engineering_low_634:0 "Low Temperature RCS Thruster"
 tech_engineering_low_634_desc:0 "Reaction control system thrusters are vital for manoeuvring in space. They are responsible for fine translational and rotational adjustments. Unfortunately, the size of the RCS thruster ports have necessitated using high temperature exhaust to provide adequate force. This is changing, as next generation impulse reactors can route colder plasma to the RCS, at a high enough pressure to be useful."
 tech_engineering_low_636:0 "Cooled Impulse Capacitance Cell"
 tech_engineering_low_636_desc:0 "Impulse capacitance cells have been available for some time, but must keep the plasma hot to prevent de-energisation. If plasma scrubbing technology was to be advanced to the point that 98% of oppositely charged particles were filtered prior to storage, we could store the plasma cold. This would make it suitable for incorporating into our stealth impulse technology."
 tech_engineering_masked_638:0 "Masked Quaratum Thruster Array"
 tech_engineering_masked_638_desc:0 "Arrays of small, multi-vectored exhaust ports are being developed. If designed correctly, a thruster array will have an easier to mask electro-thermal signature, while greatly improving manoeuvrability. The engines reactors are also being retooled to use a newly certified fuel, quaratum. It has similar operating characteristics to paralithium, but with higher pressure output, increasing thrust."
 tech_engineering_materials_1505:0 "Paragravitic Drive"
 tech_engineering_materials_1505_desc:0 "Anti-gravity assisted impulse technology was conceived near the start of our cold impulse engine program. It was quickly dismissed and forgotten due to concerns over the detectability of gravimetric distortions, and our technical ability to control them. Recently, a team of researchers revisited the idea using modern graviton technology, and created a proof-of-concept stealth paragravitic drive."
 tech_engineering_materials_1506:0 "Subspace-Shifted Thruster Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1506_desc:0 "A long forgotten experiment in multispatial sensor technology might prove to be revolutionary for stealth thrusters. It was found that graviton fields can be made to push active sensor beams into subspace. If this can be adapted for pushing thruster plasma exhaust into subspace, the sensor signature of our ships will drop dramatically. We might even be able to begin using hot plasma exhaust."
 tech_engineering_independent_642:0 "Independent Nacelle Arrangement"
 tech_engineering_independent_642_desc:0 "Warp nacelles form a part of both the warp and impulse propulsion systems. Numerous designs have been tested over the years, typically favouring either higher warp or impulse speeds. Data shows that the most balanced configuration is to place the nacelles at the leading edge of the hull. Making this our standard layout will increase our ships impulse speed while preserving warp speed."
 tech_engineering_ramscoop_643:0 "Ramscoop"
 tech_engineering_ramscoop_643_desc:0 "Interstellar space is generally described as a vacuum, but that does not mean that it is totally empty. Atoms of simple elements, such as hydrogen, exist in varying quantities; from trace amounts in deep space, to abundance in nebulae. If we design a scoop system capable of collecting this material, our ships could travel further, and at higher speeds, before needing to refuel at a starbase."
 tech_engineering_bussard_644:0 "Bussard Ramjet"
 tech_engineering_bussard_644_desc:0 "Ramscoop technology sits at the threshold of a major advance. An increased understanding of field physics is allowing us to create stronger EM fields, with increasingly small and reliable field generators. Diverting a little warp plasma to power the collectors will dramatically increase the power available. This new collector may even become a versatile tool for starship crews."
 tech_engineering_materials_1510:0 "Subspace Bubble Scooper"
 tech_engineering_materials_1510_desc:0 "Subspace bubbles have been shown to be able to move matter. It should be easy to equip the Bussard collectors with subspace field generators, extending their range and power. The main challenge to overcome will be figuring out how to stop the subspace bubble from disrupting the warp field of every nearby ship."
 tech_engineering_materials_1511:0 "Adaptive Armor Plating"
 tech_engineering_materials_1511_desc:0 "Living armour is based upon living hull technology. However, the armour and hull have different functions and are situated in different areas of our vessels. Living armour technology must diverge from our hull technology in order to be improved. The first adaptation being explored is to change the composition of the armour plating during combat, tailoring it to the weapons being used against us."
 tech_engineering_materials_1512:0 "Duranium PolyWeave Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1512_desc:0 "Self repairing hulls give our vessels significant operational autonomy, allowing them to recover from moderate damage without deviating from their assignment. The next logical step is to improve the material composition of the hull, enhancing its durability. Duranium fits the availability and toughness profile, however a way needs to be found to allow the repair nanoprobes to easily manipulate it."
 tech_engineering_materials_1513:0 "Regenerative Parametallic Plating"
 tech_engineering_materials_1513_desc:0 "Data collected on adaptive armour shows that parametalic plating is the most commonly chosen metal, by a significant margin. This indicates that we can improve our armour by removing the other metals and using the space saved to add additional layers of parametalic plating. This will not only give an overall durability increase, but greatly simplify the process of regenerating our armour."
 tech_engineering_materials_1514:0 "Paricium Memory Foam Alloy"
 tech_engineering_materials_1514_desc:0 "There are many mechanisms through which damage can be inflicted to a vessel's hull. As duranium polyweave provides sufficient kinetic penetration and explosive resistance, the current primary weaknesses are to blunt impact and mechanical shockwaves. A supplementary hull material could be created from paricium; it posses shock resistant properties and can be easily molded into various forms."
 tech_engineering_materials_1515:0 "Duranium Buckyball Sheeting"
 tech_engineering_materials_1515_desc:0 "We continuously study the performance of our hull compositions to preemptively identify weaknesses. Our findings indicate that the duranium polyweave is no longer performing adequately. A buckyball sheet structure will provide better protection. Before implementing this change, we must calculate the optimal way to layer it with the paricium memory foam and reprogram the repair nanoprobes."
 tech_engineering_materials_1516:0 "Kelindide-Victurium Composite Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1516_desc:0 "Victurium alloy has sufficient durability to be a viable replacement for duranium in our hulls. However, it has several unacceptable qualities which will interfere with standard vessel operations, including scrambling transporter signals, and disrupting hull repair nanoprobe control. It could be used as a buttressing material if an equally durable material is found to form the primary layer."
 tech_engineering_materials_1517:0 "Adaptive Structural Integrity Field"
 tech_engineering_materials_1517_desc:0 "Structural integrity fields are critical tools in keeping our vessels intact, they protect against a variety of forces and effects that would otherwise tear the vessel apart. They currently adapt to the source and type of stress, but don't reconfigure to reinforce damaged sections. Developing new field configuration algorithms to facilitate this will greatly increase our vessels survivability."
 tech_engineering_materials_1518:0 "Tetraburnium Nano-Weave Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1518_desc:0 "Victurium-kelindide hull plating is proving to be as durable as predicted, but requires orders of magnitudes more nanoprobes to repair at an acceptable rate. Tetraburnium alloy has several key properties that make it a viable replacement hull material. It is easier to manipulate than victurium and kelindide, has a high tensile strength, and is extremely heat and pressure resistant."
 tech_engineering_materials_1519:0 "High Level Structural Integrity Field"
 tech_engineering_materials_1519_desc:0 "Recent data input into stress propagation simulations suggest that adaptive structural integrity fields can be enhanced, by compartmentalising the network. A 'high level' structural field would work to keep the whole vessel intact. Individual sections would have a secondary, 'Low level', structural field network to reinforce that location, allowing the vessel to remain functional for longer."
 tech_engineering_materials_1520:0 "Tritanium Mesh"
 tech_engineering_materials_1520_desc:0 "We are having difficulty producing enough tetraburnium alloy to supply all of our vessels. Rather than accepting substandard hull construction, we need to adapt. Tritanium is both common and strong, making it suitable for use in developing a supplementary hull layer. The most efficient way of preserving the tetraburnium nanoweave layer would be to use the tritanium to create an ablative layer."
 tech_engineering_materials_1521:0 "Regenerative Ablative Armor"
 tech_engineering_materials_1521_desc:0 "Although species 116 has evaded assimilation for over two centuries, recent adaptations have allowed us to penetrate their sophisticated defences and assimilate them. Their formidable ablative armour is one of their most useful technologies. To apply it to our hulls, we must add additional matter synthesis units to our armour regeneration units, and reconfigure them to produce the new metals."
 tech_engineering_materials_1522:0 "Tritanium Shape Memory Alloy Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1522_desc:0 "The assimilation of species 9452 has added new knowledge of tritanium refining and processing. This species primary resistance factor was from the hull of their vessels. They were formed from a tritanium based substance that would attempt to recover its previous shape after sustaining damage. Adapting this substance for our hulls will greatly enhance their regenerative ability."
 tech_engineering_materials_1523:0 "Omni-Directional Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1523_desc:0 "Omni-directional thrusters are versatile, however their distributed nature weakens their overall effectiveness.  Several technical enhancements are being investigated, such as avidyne reactors, but these might not be ready for an unacceptable amount of time. If a short term solution is required, we can find a way of enlarging the existing system. It will be inefficient, but functional."
 tech_engineering_materials_1524:0 "Omni-Directional High-Gain Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1524_desc:0 "Thruster arrays have given a moderate power increase at the cost of efficiency, but further improvements are required. As avidyne engines are not yet ready, those improvements will have to be made to the current system. A portion of the current system inefficiency has been traced to the exhaust outlets; their design doesn't effectively limit plasma from dispersing along transverse trajectories."
 tech_engineering_materials_1525:0 "Omni-Directional Avidyne Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1525_desc:0 "Since assimilating species 91 and becoming aware of the substance known as avidyne, we have pursued it for use as an impulse drive reactant. We have finally developed a way of storing this potent, but unstable, chemical for long periods of time. The final obstacle is to miniaturise avidyne synthesis nodes to the point that a sufficient quantity of them can installed on our vessels."
 tech_engineering_materials_1526:0 "Omni-Directional Impulse Manifold Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1526_desc:0 "The old high-gain thrusters were adapted for avidyne plasma exhaust, but are not functioning as efficiently as simulations predicted. We currently lack sufficient data to fully diagnose the problem, but it is likely that our understanding of heavy plasma flow dynamics is flawed. Additional research will correct our understanding and allow us to design a more efficient thruster manifold array."
 tech_engineering_materials_1527:0 "Directional Paragravitic Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1527_desc:0 "Through assimilation and experimentation, our knowledge of gravity manipulation techniques has advanced immensely. Heuristics predict that we have sufficient knowledge to begin developing an engine that propels a vessel using controlled gravimetric distortions. This technology is likely to be significantly more effective and versatile than our current impulse engine operating principles."
 tech_borg_hull:0 "Living Hull"
 tech_borg_hull_desc:0 "Most species would consider metal incapable of being alive, however we are not so small minded. By using nanoprobes and matter-energy conversion technology, we can tend to our metal hulls in the same way than an organic body tends to its skin. With some further experimentation we can refine the implementation of this technology."
 tech_borg_thruster:0 "Omni-Directional Impulse"
 tech_borg_thruster_desc:0 "Our vessels hull designs are based on simple geometric shapes. They have multiple axis of symmetry, no real front or back. It would be inefficient to limit ourselves to a single direction of motion as most species do, we are capable of more. Thrusters exhaust ports can be mounted on each hull surface and feed by a decentralised network of impulse plasma generator nodes."
 tech_engineering_industry_1530:0 "Re-purposed Modular Hull Material"
 tech_engineering_industry_1530_desc:0 "By collecting and repurposing the hull parts of the species we assimilate, the Collective does not need to build our vessels from scratch. Also by making our vessels modular allows for efficient repairs."

 tech_engineering_deep_655_desc:0 "A prototype extreme range, high yield torpedo. Designed for bombarding targets from a safe distance, moderate tracking capability was added to help reduce the inaccuracy inherent to projectiles travelling large distances.

 tech_engineering_kaon_686_desc:0 "Kaon particles are formed when atomic nuclei collide with other highly charged sub-atomic particles. They have no electric charge and have about half the mass of a proton. This energy release gives the torpedo its destructive power."
 tech_engineering_plasma_682:0 "Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_plasma_682_desc:0 "These torpedoes utilise warp plasma in their warheads. The plasma is extremely difficult to contain in such a small spaceframe however, which leads to rapid decay of the torpedo casing once the weapon is fired. Due to this fact, plasma torpedoes have virtually zero tracking capability, extremely short ranges, and consume significant amounts of ship energy stores to utilise."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1690:0 "Sheathed Plasma Torpedo"

 tech_engineering_rocketry_1647_desc:0 "Expanding upon previous iterations of phased torpedo technology, the warhead and the catalyst onboard these torpedos can be kept in separate phased instances, only combining once detonation is required. As both warhead and catalyst share the same space but in different phases the resulting explosion can be increased by an order of magnitude."
 tech_engineering_radon_690:0 "Radon Plasma Warhead"
 tech_engineering_radon_690_desc:0 "These torpedoes utilise Radon plasma instead of Noble Gas plasma. It offers a slightly greater yield without losing the slow degradation of the containment field. Thus the benefit of a small window for tracking is maintained."
 tech_engineering_noble_688:0 "Noble Gas Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_noble_688_desc:0 "Noble gas provides a somewhat less volatile plasma than warp plasma, leading to a slightly longer housing period before the plasma erodes the containment shielding and torpedo casing. This means that we will have a slight window of opportunity for tracking capability."
 tech_engineering_warp_694:0 "Warp Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_warp_694_desc:0 "Warp Plasma Torpedoes utilise warp drive plasma as the weapon's armament, requiring vast amounts of ships energy reserves to fire but causing significant shield and hull damage. The weapons range is severely limited however, which means that it is only effective at close quarters combat."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1651:0 "Static Warp Plasma Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1651_desc:0 "Containing the warp plasma torpedo in a static warp shell decreases the rate of cohesion lost over time thus allowing for a much more effective warp plasma torpedo."

 tech_engineering_tricobalt_696:0 "Trilithium Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_tricobalt_696_desc:0 "Chemical synthesis has led to the creation of a compound named Trilithium, an explosive of great power. Acting as an inhibitor of nuclear reactions, such as the fusion processes within the interior of stars, even a small amount of trilithium is potentially enough to halt fusion in a star, resulting in a quantum implosion. This raw power in torpedo form will be a deadly addition to our arsenal."
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1657:0 "Tricobalt Torpedo"
 tech_engineering_rocketry_1657_desc:0 "When properly detonated, tricobalt warheads deliver an extremely high amount of explosive energy. Due to the difficulty of directing and concentrating these explosions it has only been used in mining applications. Taking advantage of gravitropic fields and inertial dampers, we might be able to create effective warheads."
