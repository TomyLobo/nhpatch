Für jede Waffenfrequenz existiert eine Schildfrequenz die den Verlust von Schilden reduziert oder verhindert. In der Praxis gibt es zu viele Möglichkeiten um dies in einem Kampf zu berechnen, jedoch haben unsere Schildharmonik-Forscher bereits seit der ersten Benutzung von Schilden, hunderttausende von Ereignissen aufgezeichnet.

 tech_engineering_improved_635:0 "Verbesserter Impulsverteiler"
 tech_engineering_improved_635_desc:0 "Avidyne impulse drives have suffered from handling problems, often being described as twitchy or jumpy. This problem has been traced to incompatibilities between the pulsed plasma exhaust, and the exhaust manifold geometry. This manifold design was restricted by the materials available. As new materials have been developed, it might now be possible to design a compatible manifold geometry."
 tech_engineering_materials_1494:0 "Shange Shunt Interface"
 tech_engineering_materials_1494_desc:0 "Engineers widely agree that modern warp cores can supply enough high energy plasma to meet our impulse engines demands, without requiring fusion reactors. Many engineering challenges must be overcome to facilitate this change. For example, new plasma shunts will be required to balance the load between the thruster array exhaust ports, without causing instability in the plasma flow characteristics."
 tech_engineering_materials_1495:0 "Compound Impulse Assembly"
 tech_engineering_materials_1495_desc:0 "The success of Shange shunt interfaces has opened new opportunities for impulse manifold designers. Ideas for a multi-vector thruster manifold have been drawn up, but current impulse assemblies can not support the design. We will need to create a new assembly, likely building it from miniaturised assembly segments, to form a flexible, compound impulse assembly."

 tech_engineering_hyper-impulse_637_desc:0 "Taking the concept of warp reactor driven impulse engines to its logical conclusion, means having dedicated matter-antimatter reactors powering the impulse engines. These small reactors will feed the impulse engines with warp plasma, which is usually reserved for energising the warp coils. There are significant engineering challenges between now, and a working prototype fitted into a starship."
 tech_engineering_driver_639:0 "Antriebsspulen-Baugruppe"
 tech_engineering_driver_639_desc:0 "When people think of warp coils, they always think of huge, power hungry coils that reside inside the nacelles of a ship. It should be possible to build much smaller warp coils and mount them behind the impulse manifold, where they will be moderately energised by the impulse plasma. This will not allow warp travel, but it will decrease the ship's mass and make the impulse engine more effective."
 tech_engineering_ullage_640:0 "Groneriumschwund-Nachbrenner"
 tech_engineering_ullage_640_desc:0 "Although more advanced propulsion systems are now the standard, older style chemical thrusters have a range of uses. The latest high performance fuel to be synthesised is a liquid called Gronerium. Before we can begin using this fuel, we must design a modern liquid fuel storage system, overcoming the reliability problems inherent to using liquid fuelled thrusters in low gravity environments."

 tech_engineering_inertial_641_desc:0 "Inertial dampeners absorb the inertial force generated by impulse and warp drive acceleration.

Current inertial dampeners don't have the capability to do so, as it would increase their size and power consumption. By designing new dampeners we can equip starships with them if required."
 tech_engineering_materials_1500:0 "FIB-3-Nachbrenner"
 tech_engineering_materials_1500_desc:0 "Although fusion reactors are becoming obsolete in primary impulse drives, they still have a place in secondary propulsion. The Fusion Intermix Booster project is attempting to use a fusion reactor to create thrust plasma, but then mix it with a small amount of antimatter to increase its temperature to 43keV. Heat and pressure stress induced structural integrity failures are still causing problems."
 tech_engineering_materials_1501:0 "Subimpuls-Paralithiumtriebwerke"
 tech_engineering_materials_1501_desc:0 "Paralithium synthesis technology has long been on the watchlist of Avidyne Stealth R&D Yards. Experimental paralithium engines have been shown to produce relatively cold, highly ionised plasma. Hopefully, this can be combined with ion engine technology to create a potent cold thruster. A new paralithium synthesis technique, yielding two orders of magnitude more fuel, will allow research to resume."
 tech_engineering_low_634:0 "Niedertemperatur-RCS-Triebwerk"
 tech_engineering_low_634_desc:0 "Reaction control system thrusters are vital for manoeuvring in space. They are responsible for fine translational and rotational adjustments. Unfortunately, the size of the RCS thruster ports have necessitated using high temperature exhaust to provide adequate force. This is changing, as next generation impulse reactors can route colder plasma to the RCS, at a high enough pressure to be useful."
 tech_engineering_low_636:0 "Niedertemperatur-Polaritätstriebwerk"
 tech_engineering_low_636_desc:0 "Impulse capacitance cells have been available for some time, but must keep the plasma hot to prevent de-energisation. If plasma scrubbing technology was to be advanced to the point that 98% of oppositely charged particles were filtered prior to storage, we could store the plasma cold. This would make it suitable for incorporating into our stealth impulse technology."
 tech_engineering_masked_638:0 "Maskierte Antriebsphalanx"
 tech_engineering_masked_638_desc:0 "Arrays of small, multi-vectored exhaust ports are being developed. If designed correctly, a thruster array will have an easier to mask electro-thermal signature, while greatly improving manoeuvrability. The engines reactors are also being retooled to use a newly certified fuel, quaratum. It has similar operating characteristics to paralithium, but with higher pressure output, increasing thrust."
 tech_engineering_materials_1505:0 "Paragravitischer Antrieb"
 tech_engineering_materials_1505_desc:0 "Anti-gravity assisted impulse technology was conceived near the start of our cold impulse engine program. It was quickly dismissed and forgotten due to concerns over the detectability of gravimetric distortions, and our technical ability to control them. Recently, a team of researchers revisited the idea using modern graviton technology, and created a proof-of-concept stealth paragravitic drive."
 tech_engineering_materials_1506:0 "Subraum-Verschobene Triebwerkssphalanx"
 tech_engineering_materials_1506_desc:0 "A long forgotten experiment in multispatial sensor technology might prove to be revolutionary for stealth thrusters. It was found that graviton fields can be made to push active sensor beams into subspace. If this can be adapted for pushing thruster plasma exhaust into subspace, the sensor signature of our ships will drop dramatically. We might even be able to begin using hot plasma exhaust."
 tech_engineering_independent_642:0 "Unabhängige Gondelanordnung"
 tech_engineering_independent_642_desc:0 "Warp nacelles form a part of both the warp and impulse propulsion systems. Numerous designs have been tested over the years, typically favouring either higher warp or impulse speeds. Data shows that the most balanced configuration is to place the nacelles at the leading edge of the hull. Making this our standard layout will increase our ships impulse speed while preserving warp speed."
 tech_engineering_ramscoop_643:0 "Ramscoop"
 tech_engineering_ramscoop_643_desc:0 "Interstellar space is generally described as a vacuum, but that does not mean that it is totally empty. Atoms of simple elements, such as hydrogen, exist in varying quantities; from trace amounts in deep space, to abundance in nebulae. If we design a scoop system capable of collecting this material, our ships could travel further, and at higher speeds, before needing to refuel at a starbase."
 tech_engineering_bussard_644:0 "Bussard-Staustrahl-Triebwerk"
 tech_engineering_bussard_644_desc:0 "Ramscoop technology sits at the threshold of a major advance. An increased understanding of field physics is allowing us to create stronger EM fields, with increasingly small and reliable field generators. Diverting a little warp plasma to power the collectors will dramatically increase the power available. This new collector may even become a versatile tool for starship crews."
 tech_engineering_materials_1510:0 "Subspace Bubble Scooper"
 tech_engineering_materials_1510_desc:0 "Subspace bubbles have been shown to be able to move matter. It should be easy to equip the Bussard collectors with subspace field generators, extending their range and power. The main challenge to overcome will be figuring out how to stop the subspace bubble from disrupting the warp field of every nearby ship."
 tech_engineering_materials_1511:0 "Adaptive Panzerbeplattung"
 tech_engineering_materials_1511_desc:0 "Living armour is based upon living hull technology. However, the armour and hull have different functions and are situated in different areas of our vessels. Living armour technology must diverge from our hull technology in order to be improved. The first adaptation being explored is to change the composition of the armour plating during combat, tailoring it to the weapons being used against us."
 tech_engineering_materials_1512:0 "Duranium-PolyWeave-Hülle"
 tech_engineering_materials_1512_desc:0 "Self repairing hulls give our vessels significant operational autonomy, allowing them to recover from moderate damage without deviating from their assignment. The next logical step is to improve the material composition of the hull, enhancing its durability. Duranium fits the availability and toughness profile, however a way needs to be found to allow the repair nanoprobes to easily manipulate it."
 tech_engineering_materials_1513:0 "Regenerative Parametallic Plating"
 tech_engineering_materials_1513_desc:0 "Data collected on adaptive armour shows that parametalic plating is the most commonly chosen metal, by a significant margin. This indicates that we can improve our armour by removing the other metals and using the space saved to add additional layers of parametalic plating. This will not only give an overall durability increase, but greatly simplify the process of regenerating our armour."
 tech_engineering_materials_1514:0 "Paricium Memory Foam Alloy"
 tech_engineering_materials_1514_desc:0 "There are many mechanisms through which damage can be inflicted to a vessel's hull. As duranium polyweave provides sufficient kinetic penetration and explosive resistance, the current primary weaknesses are to blunt impact and mechanical shockwaves. A supplementary hull material could be created from paricium; it posses shock resistant properties and can be easily molded into various forms."
 tech_engineering_materials_1515:0 "Duranium Buckyball Sheeting"
 tech_engineering_materials_1515_desc:0 "We continuously study the performance of our hull compositions to preemptively identify weaknesses. Our findings indicate that the duranium polyweave is no longer performing adequately. A buckyball sheet structure will provide better protection. Before implementing this change, we must calculate the optimal way to layer it with the paricium memory foam and reprogram the repair nanoprobes."
 tech_engineering_materials_1516:0 "Kelindide-Victurium Composite Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1516_desc:0 "Victurium alloy has sufficient durability to be a viable replacement for duranium in our hulls. However, it has several unacceptable qualities which will interfere with standard vessel operations, including scrambling transporter signals, and disrupting hull repair nanoprobe control. It could be used as a buttressing material if an equally durable material is found to form the primary layer."
 tech_engineering_materials_1517:0 "Adaptives Strukturelles Integritätsfeld"
 tech_engineering_materials_1517_desc:0 "Structural integrity fields are critical tools in keeping our vessels intact, they protect against a variety of forces and effects that would otherwise tear the vessel apart. They currently adapt to the source and type of stress, but don't reconfigure to reinforce damaged sections. Developing new field configuration algorithms to facilitate this will greatly increase our vessels survivability."
 tech_engineering_materials_1518:0 "Tetraburnium Nano-Weave Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1518_desc:0 "Victurium-kelindide hull plating is proving to be as durable as predicted, but requires orders of magnitudes more nanoprobes to repair at an acceptable rate. Tetraburnium alloy has several key properties that make it a viable replacement hull material. It is easier to manipulate than victurium and kelindide, has a high tensile strength, and is extremely heat and pressure resistant."
 tech_engineering_materials_1519:0 "High Level Structural Integrity Field"
 tech_engineering_materials_1519_desc:0 "Recent data input into stress propagation simulations suggest that adaptive structural integrity fields can be enhanced, by compartmentalising the network. A 'high level' structural field would work to keep the whole vessel intact. Individual sections would have a secondary, 'Low level', structural field network to reinforce that location, allowing the vessel to remain functional for longer."
 tech_engineering_materials_1520:0 "Tritanium-Gitter"
 tech_engineering_materials_1520_desc:0 "We are having difficulty producing enough tetraburnium alloy to supply all of our vessels. Rather than accepting substandard hull construction, we need to adapt. Tritanium is both common and strong, making it suitable for use in developing a supplementary hull layer. The most efficient way of preserving the tetraburnium nanoweave layer would be to use the tritanium to create an ablative layer."
 tech_engineering_materials_1521:0 "Regenerative Ablative Armor"
 tech_engineering_materials_1521_desc:0 "Although species 116 has evaded assimilation for over two centuries, recent adaptations have allowed us to penetrate their sophisticated defences and assimilate them. Their formidable ablative armour is one of their most useful technologies. To apply it to our hulls, we must add additional matter synthesis units to our armour regeneration units, and reconfigure them to produce the new metals."
 tech_engineering_materials_1522:0 "Tritanium Shape Memory Alloy Hull"
 tech_engineering_materials_1522_desc:0 "The assimilation of species 9452 has added new knowledge of tritanium refining and processing. This species primary resistance factor was from the hull of their vessels. They were formed from a tritanium based substance that would attempt to recover its previous shape after sustaining damage. Adapting this substance for our hulls will greatly enhance their regenerative ability."
 tech_engineering_materials_1523:0 "Omnidirektionale Impulsphalanx"
 tech_engineering_materials_1523_desc:0 "Omni-directional thrusters are versatile, however their distributed nature weakens their overall effectiveness.  Several technical enhancements are being investigated, such as avidyne reactors, but these might not be ready for an unacceptable amount of time. If a short term solution is required, we can find a way of enlarging the existing system. It will be inefficient, but functional."
 tech_engineering_materials_1524:0 "Omni-Directional High-Gain Impulse Array"
 tech_engineering_materials_1524_desc:0 "Thruster arrays have given a moderate power increase at the cost of efficiency, but further improvements are required. As avidyne engines are not yet ready, those improvements will have to be made to the current system. A portion of the current system inefficiency has been traced to the exhaust outlets; their design doesn't effectively limit plasma from dispersing along transverse trajectories."
 tech_engineering_materials_1525:0 "Omnidirektionale Avidyne-Impulsphalanx"
 tech_engineering_materials_1525_desc:0 "Since assimilating species 91 and becoming aware of the substance known as avidyne, we have pursued it for use as an impulse drive reactant. We have finally developed a way of storing this potent, but unstable, chemical for long periods of time. The final obstacle is to miniaturise avidyne synthesis nodes to the point that a sufficient quantity of them can installed on our vessels."
 tech_engineering_materials_1526:0 "Omnidirektionale Impulsverteilerphalanx"
 tech_engineering_materials_1526_desc:0 "The old high-gain thrusters were adapted for avidyne plasma exhaust, but are not functioning as efficiently as simulations predicted. We currently lack sufficient data to fully diagnose the problem, but it is likely that our understanding of heavy plasma flow dynamics is flawed. Additional research will correct our understanding and allow us to design a more efficient thruster manifold array."
 tech_engineering_materials_1527:0 "Direktionale Paragravitische Impulsphalanx"
 tech_engineering_materials_1527_desc:0 "Through assimilation and experimentation, our knowledge of gravity manipulation techniques has advanced immensely.

This technology is likely to be significantly more effective and versatile than our current impulse engine operating principles."
 tech_borg_hull:0 "Lebende Hülle"
 tech_borg_hull_desc:0 "Most species would consider metal incapable of being alive, however we are not so small minded. By using nanoprobes and matter-energy conversion technology, we can tend to our metal hulls in the same way than an organic body tends to its skin. With some further experimentation we can refine the implementation of this technology."
 tech_borg_thruster:0 "Omnidirektionaler Impuls"
 tech_borg_thruster_desc:0 "Our vessels hull designs are based on simple geometric shapes. They have multiple axis of symmetry, no real front or back. It would be inefficient to limit ourselves to a single direction of motion as most species do, we are capable of more. Thrusters exhaust ports can be mounted on each hull surface and feed by a decentralised network of impulse plasma generator nodes."
