 gov_darsay_converts_desc:0 "Under the light of the Waxing Cycle and the rule of the God Emperor are stretched the Kingdoms of D'Arsay, as numerous as the stars in the sky. The D'Arsay Federal government, composed of the Emperor themselves and the advisory Council of Clans, holds in theory ultimate power. In practice, however, the D'Arsay people retain much of their original, ancient and proud civilization. The D'Arsay culture grew in the time of peace, many millennia ago, that brought about the slow unification of many small kingdoms, villages and tribes. All of them now share a common elite culture, rich in iconography, architecture and mythology, but most still have their own heritage, language and currency. "
 gov_stagnant_democracy:0 "Ancient Democracy"
 gov_stagnant_democracy_desc:0 "A noble attempt to merge together the governments of several cooperating species, the First Federation roots range back over 50,000 years. The original government was a myriad collection of direct democracy ideals together with highly complex compromises ensuring every species had a say in the running of the Federation. The millennia since then, as the Federation sunk into decline, seclusion and ennui, has only complicated matters further.\n\nThe result is a system heavy with rituals, customs, bureaucracy and procedure, requiring approval from multiple local community forums and elective regional archons. The leader of the First Federation, the President, has only the powers of a figure head, while the very little actual power is fought over by the various committees. The Parliament of Parishes, that has a single volunteer representative from each region, is currently the most powerful body – but it has nearly 150 thousand members."

 gov_high_council:0 "High Council"
 gov_high_council_desc:0 "Ever since the death of Kahless, the Klingon Empire has been ruled by the High Council - a militaristic and feudal form of oligarchy, stepped in tradition and honor. Sometimes named the Klingon High Command, all decisions concerning the state are taken by the Chancellor. He rules by the will of the Council, representing 24 of the great houses in the Empire."
 gov_krenim_imperium:0 "Technochronatic Empire"
 gov_krenim_imperium_desc:0 "The Krenim Imperium government is an odd mixture of enlightened technocratic principles with a highly militaristic autocracy. All citizens are expected to serve in the military, but that establishment is remarkably open to supporting and financing works of art and scientific research. Many military commanders are also artists or scientists. From this unique attitude the Temporal Defense Agency sprung forth, benefitting from complete access to both a roster of creative, motivated scientists and the vast funds reserved to military applications. The Agency is now the largest department of the Imperium, in charge of creating a stable and prosperous future of the Imperium."
 gov_detapa_council:0 "Civilian Council"
 gov_detapa_council_desc:0 "The Detapa Civilian Council of the Cardassian Union started as a nominally democratic executive body, in theory in direct control over the Cardassian High Command and the Obsidian Order. In time, however, government the dividing line between the civil administration and the military blurred, then disappeared. The eleven members of the Council are selected by a democratic vote, but they are still nothing more than puppets in a vast military machine."
 gov_romulan_senate:0 "Romulan Senate"
 gov_romulan_senate_desc:0 "The Romulan Star Empire has endured for two thousand years, and in that time it has hardly changed, with new governmental organizations and structured layering one atop another. The public face of the government is the Senate, with senators selected as long-term representatives of their provinces. There are no term limits to a Romulan senator and thus they can spend decades squabbling over position and power. The truly powerful ones maneuver themselves into a seat on the shadowy continuing committee, that has the power to derail the career of any senator and even to select the next Praetor."
 gov_great_link:0 "The Great Link"
 gov_great_link_desc:0 "There are no words to describe the Great Link, the heart and soul of the Dominion. It is not a single entity. The governmental edifice that has slowly accrued around it, to manage the business of the lesser species that make up the Dominion, is no less convoluted. Yet, despite it all, the Link prevails, and even thrives."
 gov_vedek_assembly:0 "Council of Ministers"
 gov_vedek_assembly_desc:0 "Nominally a democracy governed by an elected chamber of ministers, the long-lasting Bajoran Second Republic is in fact headed by several political bodies that each share a sphere of influence and control. Each body is headed by prominent members of a certain D'jarra caste. In the last few centuries, the main foci of power lay within the Vedek Assembly, high-ranking priests that are led by the Kai, the highest religious authority in the Republic."
 gov_ferengi_board:0 "Corporate Oligarchy"
 gov_ferengi_board_desc:0 "The Ferengi Alliance is a unique and highly unstructured government, which promotes a mostly unregulated laissez-faire economy coupled with a highly democratic constitution that grants every citizen - or at least every male citizen - equal opportunities under the Bill of Opportunities. The Alliance is ultimately ruled by a Grand Nagus that may appoint his own successor, but the Nagus is limited by the Board of Liquidators of the Ferengi Commerce Association and the fact he holds very little actual authority."
 gov_deliberative_democracy:0 "Deliberative Democracy"
 gov_deliberative_democracy_desc:0 "Cherishing diversity of opinions as well as a good argument, the Tellarite government is a pure reflection of the species - bewildering, conflicting and yet strangely effective. Unlike most representative democracies, the Technocracy does not have an executive body or base its decision making on majority votes. Instead, the elected governors meet in the grand forum every day to debate policy, enacting new rules and resolutions only when they reach sufficient consensus."
 gov_sheliak_corporate:0 "Corporatocracy"
 gov_sheliak_corporate_desc:0 "The Sheliak Corporate is a misnomer - it is neither a proper interstellar government nor a capitalist conglomerate. The silicon-based species cares very little for material wealth, but instead value precision and efficiency. The Corporate was established by several academic concerns on Shelia for the sole purpose of dictating all regulation involved with interstellar affairs, including colonization, commerce and diplomacy. While the Corporate is not in charge of enforcement or execution, the strict adherence of all Sheliak to the scripture of the law makes the Corporate the de-facto government."
 gov_constitutional_empire:0 "Constitutional Empire"
 gov_constitutional_empire_desc:0 "After a long, graceful transition from a militant planetary empire to a space-bound constitutional monarchy, the queen-emperor of the Andorian Empire chooses to die heirless and divest all power to the Parliament. Centuries later, the Empire is now a pure representative democracy in all but name. The Empty Throne still resides in a chamber of Parliament Hall and acts as the figurative head of state, while the Chancellor rules the Empire."
 gov_borg_unimatrix:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalist Communities"
 gov_borg_unimatrix_desc:0 "In the dream, everyone is equal. Once Unimatrix Zero became a reality, the former dreamers sought to preserve this equality in their new utopia. The Commune is firmly guided by moralistic principles, solidarity and non-violence. Almost all decisions are decided on the local level by a direct democratic vote, with very few powers vested in the global, representative government that guides and protects the Unimatrix denizens as a whole."
 gov_borg_cooperative:0 "Ex-Drone Cooperative"
 gov_borg_cooperative_desc:0 "The Cooperative retains many of the augments and communication devices and infrastructure of the former Collective, which allows the ex-drones to still create a highly capable and response direct democracy. While this form of government can be myriad in indecision, the Cooperative has clear guidelines that allow local leaders to act when needed, often ceasing a great deal of temporal power. While there is certainly an enormous potential for future abuse, so far, the Cooperative functions well, as every ex-drone remembers the horror of their lack of individuality, and will never dream of limiting the freedom of their compatriots."
 gov_borg_cyborg:0 "Holy Machine Empire"
 gov_borg_cyborg_desc:0 "In millennia past, there have been numerous Holy Empires where the Leader was worshipped as an infallible living god. When that Leader is an eternal, mechanical being of great intellect, however, something truly different emerges. The Leader represents everything the Collective ever aspired to be but never succeeded, and it is the center of every facet of the new Empire. With its great computational speed and full, remote access to every ex-drone, the Leader is also capable of making almost every decision in the Empire."
 gov_elder_council:0 "Elder Council"
 gov_elder_council_desc:0 "The Kelpien government is a unique combination of a fully egalitarian society where every member of the herd is equal, elder worship and ancient feudal roots. The Kelpien never had a war between them, but their original roots stem in local, nomadic herds that clung together for protection. Millennia ago, those small kingdom/herds, or duchies as they become known, swore allegiance to the ancient Empire - ruled by a small collection of Kelpien that were brave and skilled enough to protect the other duchies from predators. In time, the Empire became a free union where each duchy is represented by an Elder Kelpien with senses developed to an almost mystical ability. Nowadays, the Elders are selected by popular vote, but they are still, more often the naught, true Elders."
 gov_ministry_elder:0 "Ministry of Elders"
 gov_ministry_elder_desc:0 "The Voth Ministry of Elders watches over the many Circles of Voth society, ensuring that Doctrine, the ancient tales that tell of Voth supremacy and divine right over the galaxy, is adhered to. Any threats to Doctrine are dealt with quickly, and robustly, which does stifle development but ensures the way of life of the Elders is not threatened."
 gov_circle_matrons:0 "Circle of Matrons"
 gov_circle_matrons_desc:0 "Skrreean society men deems that men are too emotional to be effective leaders, and as such are relegated to a subservient position. The Circle of Matrons, some of the most prominent women on the planet, ensure that female led superiority cannot be threatened and works to actively promote the superiority of Skrreean culture."
 gov_curator_council:0 "Curator Council"
 gov_curator_council_desc:0 "The Curator Council was once but a small, if highly respected, arm of the Hur'q Domain government. The Council was a loose body that represented the leaders, fleet admirals and ship captains of the great Museums of Hur'q - vast, floating, nomadic ships that harvested, scavenged, curated and displayed biological beings and technological advances from across the galaxy. After the fall of the Domain and the Purge, the only Hur'q left alive in the galaxy were the few museum Curators that had the wisdom to flee to the corners of the galaxy. Over centuries, those fleets slowly returned, establishing a new government, a council of the most powerful, ruthless and cunning Curator-War-Captains."
 gov_ruling_conclave:0 "Ruling Conclave"
 gov_ruling_conclave_desc:0 "The Tholians maintain that their form of government is the highest level of democracy found in the galaxy. All local matters are decided by a local forum, or Lattice, representing all local Tholians in a direct democracy. Members of each Lattice also choose Magistrates, that make decisions in case of emergencies or deal with all external matters. Tholian ship captains are chosen by their peers, in a similar fashion. The Tholian Assembly is ruled by several organizations made by volunteering Magistrates, that are chosen for life to serve in their new post by virtue of merit and performance. The highest organization is the Ruling Conclave, that has little executive power but holds the entire knowledge of every Lattice in the Assembly."
 gov_medical_directorate:0 "Medical Directorate"
 gov_medical_directorate_desc:0 "This Vidiian Sodality is nominally a representative democracy with an elected civilian body. In practice, the Sodality is a brutal, materialistic and highly specific form of oligarchy. The entire governmental apparatus deals with the pursuit of a cure to the Phage and the procurement of replacement organs, at the cost of everything else. Those agencies are under the control of an advisory of committee of medical practitioners and biological researchers that holds a huge amount of power, and de facto rules the Sodality."
 gov_commission:0 "Purity Commission"
 gov_commission_desc:0 "This government is a form of oligarchy that is rabidly obsessed with genetic research and superiority. While they do not see their own species as superior to other lifeforms in the galaxy, they are entirely assured that a significant minority of their own population, due to gender, ethnicity, nationality or phenotype, is inferior. The entire government is built around the preservation of those ingrained notions and divisions between superiors and inferior members of society."

Each Bynar pair still has its own distinct personality, and Bynar's government is in fact a highly active direct democracy facilitated via the instantaneous connection with Central Computer.

This makes storing antiprotons very difficult, as it would have to be a perfect vacuum. antiprotons are created in a particle accelerator conduit using Hydrogen at high energies, then is contained in a powerful magnetic field, and when fired the concentrated anti-protons are fired at a constant rate causing massive damage to the target.
